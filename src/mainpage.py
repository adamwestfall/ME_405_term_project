                                        Our Term Project consists of hardware drivers, tasks for those drivers, vector <br>
                                        and share files to transmit data, and a main file to tie all parts of the code together. <br> 
                                        Attached you will see the associated Task Diagram, Finite State Machine Diagram, <br>
                                        and Closed Loop Controller modelled in Simulink that show the design of our interacting files. <br>

   The software design is detailed in the following subsection, task diagrams, and FSM's. <br>
   
   @subsection thermal_camera_task      <br>
   The Thermal Camera Subsection Task controls the calibraiton of the thermal camera.
